**SENTIMENT ANALYSIS WEB APP**

This Streamlit-based web application performs sentiment analysis on product reviews. Users can input review text, and the app predicts whether the sentiment is positive or negative, using a trained Naive Bayes classifier. The model was built using TF-IDF vectorization and trained on a labeled dataset of customer reviews, optimized for accuracy and clarity.
The app is designed to be simple, fast, and accessibleâ€”ideal for showcasing how machine learning can be applied to real-world consumer feedback.

**_Model Training & Preprocessing_**

Model training was conducted in Google Colab, including:
- Dataset cleaning and preprocessing (Datset taken from Kaggle)
- TF-IDF vectorization
- Model selection & tuning via GridSearchCV
- Handling class imbalance
- Exporting model & vectorizer as .pkl files

**_Streamlit App Deployment_**

The app was built using Streamlit and deployed via Streamlit Cloud.
Main features include:
- Text input and sentiment prediction
- Modular and readable code (app.py)
- Pickle-loaded model and vectorizer
