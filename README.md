**SENTIMENT ANALYSIS WEB APP**

A user-friendly Streamlit web application that performs sentiment analysis on text input using a trained machine learning model.

**_Model Training & Preprocessing_**

Model training was conducted in Google Colab, including:
- Dataset cleaning and preprocessing (Datset taken from Kaggle)
- TF-IDF vectorization
- Model selection & tuning via GridSearchCV
- Handling class imbalance
- Exporting model & vectorizer as .pkl files

**_Colab Notebook_**

Or check the notebook in this repo: Model_training.ipynb

**_Streamlit App Deployment_**

The app was built using Streamlit and deployed via Streamlit Cloud.
Main features include:
- Text input and sentiment prediction
- Modular and readable code (app.py)
- Pickle-loaded model and vectorizer
